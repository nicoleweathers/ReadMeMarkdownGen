## &#9733; About

**DRY Obsession** ☜This is my motivation for writing most of the code that I write. 

Will Generate a nicely formatted markdown ReadMe file, which you can also edit if needed or leave as-is and use in your project. Saves a ton of time because you don't have to manually format a MD file. Just fill in the fields you want to add and let the generator do the the rest.

As you can see, it is one of my first repositories (on here), so I created it while brainstorming ideas for how to get in the practice of using GitHub (and GIT). I didn't want to have to spend hours just to write an attractive README file for every project; and that is why this was created. 

I literally spent hours looking at other README files on GitHub to get ideas while determining the essentials and borrowing bits and pieces from several sources to come up with a final master piece. Here, you will find le crème de la crème.

## 🤝 Credits and Acknowledgements

To create this web app, I needed some inspiration, so I searched for good README file recommendations. Ultimately, here are the resources that helped get some good ideas for how to create the ultimate readme.md file:

+ [@matiassingers](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) : Saved me time so I didn't have to use a search engine for my research.
+ [amplication](https://github.com/amplication/amplication#readme) : Multiple image screenshots in collapsible section.
+ [ajeetdsouza](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide#readme) : Nice file tree.
+ [aimeos-typo3](https://github.com/aimeos/aimeos-typo3#readme) : Nice layout, flow, visually attractive.
+ [EventualShop](https://github.com/AntonioFalcaoJr/EventualShop#readme) : Attractive banner and attractive like [electron-markdownify](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/electron-markdownify#readme) & [aimeos-typo3](https://github.com/aimeos/aimeos-typo3#readme).
+ [electron-markdownify](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/electron-markdownify#readme) : 
**BEST BY FAR** - This one was like the starting point for my design because it is attractive yet simple _which is perfect for me. As cool as all those emojis/icons are, it's too overwhelming for me as an autistic person. I like clean yet attractive styles; and this one did it.
+ [werewolves-assistant-api-next](https://github.com/antoinezanardi/werewolves-assistant-api-next#readme) : 
 **Worth mentioning**  I did not use any of their styling for this because it was a bit much for me (autistic). But I love how complete it is and I think it is really worth mentioning.
